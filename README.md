OurLove Token $LOVE

"Our Love" is a speculative smart contract built on the Ethereum Blockchain that creates a "LOVE" token.

Smart contracts have been hailed by some as the codified replacement for imperfect human interactions. 
Building relationships in a trustless fashion.
In some cases, their proponents seek to replace laws, which are malleable/interpretable, by rigid code which is read and executed by a computer.
Proofs of concept have been made for mortgages, corporations, etc.
Smart contracts for loans already exist in the Decentralized Finance ecosystem

I paraphrase from Harvard Law:
"Smart contracts is a term used to describe computer code that automatically executes all or parts of an agreement and is stored on a blockchain-based platform. 
The code is usually the manifestation of the agreement between the parties such as transferring funds from Party A to Party B. 
The code itself is replicated across multiple nodes of a blockchain and, therefore, benefits from the security, permanence and immutability that a blockchain offers."

I figured it would be interesting to further embed what to me are the uncapturable qualities of human life into code.

Why not make a smart contract for romantic relationships?

The contract holds a certain narrative quality. 

Here are some of the attributes of the contract:

1 - 0 initial supply (you start with no tokens), because love is a choice

2 - The token is mintable (you can make new tokens), because love can be created out of nothing

3 - The token has no supply cap (you can make an unlimited amount of tokens), because love is infinite

4 - The token is burnable (you can permanently remove tokens from circulation forever), because love can be self-destructive

5 - The token can be paused (all activities or transactions ceased), because sometimes, love ends.


Both parties can mint new tokens as they advance along in the relationship.
Tokens can be exchanged between partners for deeds in line with the partner's love languages.

The contract is fully functional, so you can deploy it in your Test Network with your partner. 

One last thing, because the token is deployed on the blockchain
Even if the relationship ends
Even if you die
Even if all the tokens are burned
Traces of all your transactions will forever remain

I think that's kind of sweet
